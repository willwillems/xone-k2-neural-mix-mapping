Place the file in `~/Music/djay/MIDI Mappings` and start Djay Pro.

## Editing this mapping.

Lookup [MIDI note numbers](https://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies) and use the [Xone K2 manual](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/778554/Allen-And-Heath-Xone-K2.html?page=16#manual) to manually edit the mapping.

Note: The `<key>output</key>` needs to be paired with an empty self-closing `<dict/>` see file for examples.
